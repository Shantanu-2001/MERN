            <p> A good example of a paragraph contains a topic sentence, details and a conclusion. 'There are many different kinds of animals that live in China. Tigers and leopards are animals that live in China's forests in the north. In the jungles, monkeys swing in the trees and elephants walk through the brush. </p>

            <p> There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:<br>

                Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)<br>
                Description: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)
                Process: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequenceâ€”first, second, third. (See an example.)
                Classification: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (See an example.)
                Illustration: Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step process below.)

            <pre>Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose flour to it.Next, add salt and baking powder in it and sieve the flour once. Then, make a well in the centre and add 2 teaspoon of olive oil to it. On the other hand, take a little warm water and mix the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. The yeast will rise in the meantime. Once the yeast has risen, add it to the flour knead the dough nicely using some water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours. Then knead the dough once again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.</pre>

    <!--  

<h1> to <h6> = These are heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define headings of different levels.
               <h1> is the highest level and <h6> is the lowest level.
               They are used to structure the content and indicate the hierarchy of information.


<p> = These are paragraph tags <p> used to define paragraphs of text. 
      Paragraphs are typically used to organize and present textual content on a webpage.


<hr> = The <hr> tag is a horizontal rule, used to create a thematic break or a visual separator between content sections.

<br> = The <br> tag is a line break tag used to insert a single line break in the content.
       It does not have a closing tag because it's what's known as an empty element. 
       It's often used to create additional spacing between lines of text or to start a new line within a paragraph without starting a new paragraph.


<pre> = The <pre> tag is used to define preformatted text. 
        Text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

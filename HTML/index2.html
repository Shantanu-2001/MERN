            <p> A good example of a paragraph contains a topic sentence, details and a conclusion. 'There are many different kinds of animals that live in China. Tigers and leopards are animals that live in China's forests in the north. In the jungles, monkeys swing in the trees and elephants walk through the brush. </p>

            <p> There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:<br>

                Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)<br>
                Description: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)
                Process: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequenceâ€”first, second, third. (See an example.)
                Classification: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (See an example.)
                Illustration: Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step process below.)
